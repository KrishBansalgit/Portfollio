    <p class="tech-description">I have a strong foundation in programming with proficiency in C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript. On the frontend, I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, while on the backend I work with Node.js and Java (Servlets). Along with this, I have practical experience in handling databases like MySQL and Supabase, which allows me to build full-stack and scalable applications.</p>
    <p class="tech-discription">To support my development workflow, I use tools such as Git, GitHub, VS Code, and Postman for efficient coding, collaboration, and testing. I also have hands-on experience in integrating APIs, including the OpenWeatherMap API, Twilio (for OTP services), and REST APIs, which has strengthened my ability to design and implement real-world, user-focused solutions.</p>

    <p class="self">Hi, I'm Krish Bansal</p>
    <p class="description">Hi, I'm Krish Bansal, an enthusiastic and dedicated student currently pursuing MCA (Integrated) from Raja Balwant Singh Management Technical Campus, Khadari, Agra. I have always been passionate about technology, coding, and problem-solving, and I'm constantly working on improving my skills in software development, web technologies, and innovative IT solutions.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="description">Before my MCA journey, I completed my 10th (2020) with 70% and 12th (2022) with 56% from Kids Corner Happy Inter College, Agra (UP Board). These academic milestones have shaped my foundation and motivated me to keep growing in the field of computer applications.</p>
